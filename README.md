# Full Stack Development Test - Week One

This assessment tests your understanding of loops, objects, arrays, and basic functions.

## Guidelines

- In case you copy previously written code, you should be able to explain it on the white board

## Tips

- Use your whiteboard to draw the problem
- Write pseudocode before writing code.

## Self-Assessment

Give yourself a grade for each question. Explain why you gave yourself that grade.

| Grade  | Explanation              |
| :----: | -------------------------|
|   4    | I understood this completely and did not struggle answering it.    |
|   3    | I think I did well, but I didn't totally understand why it worked. |
|   2    | I think I was close, but I didn't get the answer. |
|   1    | I am struggling with this question. |
|   0    | I did not attempt this question (explain why) |

### 1. Palindrome

- Grade: 2
- Explanation: I understand the general logic behind the excercise and when I think about it, 
it makes sense in my head but I am finding it difficult to write it down in "machine" language.

### 2. Add grid items

- Grade: 2
- Explanation: I feel that I was quite close to cracking this one (I hope), but I think there are some parts in the code that
are missing.

### 3. Create file name string in CamelCase

- Grade: 2
- Explanation: This is the one that I probably understood the most and had some sort of solution layed out for each step, 
but I saved it for the last and ran out of time in the end.

### 4. Create pattern

- Grade: 1
- Explanation: This is the one I understood the least and althohg we did a similar excercise using strings some time ago,
I wasn't sure the same solution could be applied to numbers - but it was the only solution I could think of.

Note: sorry for the messy and unfinished code, I tried to allocate the same-ish amount of time to each question
so I would have a fair go at each of them, but I coudln't finish any of them, so perhaps it would have been a better strategy
to focus on one or two questions instead.
